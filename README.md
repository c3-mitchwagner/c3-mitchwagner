Hi, I’m Mitch Wagner! I’m interested in programming languages, algorithms, and
distributed computing. This profile was for my previous work at C3 AI (GitHub: @c3-e); starting February 2026, I will be working working at Antithesis (GitHub: @antithesishq).

For my personal account, please see @mitchwagner.
